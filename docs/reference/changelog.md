## 1.7.2 (2021-08-23)

Fixes:

- Path not specified error in Windows when running on a long path has been
  fixed.

## 1.7.1 (2021-08-05)

## 1.7.0 (2021-08-04)

This release brings the following improvements:

- CSV support (See
  [renaming from a CSV file](https://github.com/ayoisaiah/f2/wiki/Renaming-from-a-CSV-file)).
- Improved no color options. You can now set the `F2_NO_COLOR` environmental
  variable or use the brand new `--no-color` flag to disable coloured output.
- Validation error messages are now much clearer (no longer mixing emoji and
  text).
- Console output has been improved by using
  [pterm](https://github.com/pterm/pterm). The green, red, and yellow colours
  are slightly different now due to this change.

  `~/Library/Application Support/f2/backups` on macOS, and
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\f2\backups` on Windows. The previous backup directory
  (`~/.f2/backups`) is still supported (in case you have existing backups
  there), but new backup files will not be created there anymore. This change
  was made to conform to the
  [XDG specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)
  and conventions for storing application files on each operating system, and to
  avoid cluttering up the home directory.
- A `--verbose` option was added for outputting each renaming operation in
  `--exec` mode.
